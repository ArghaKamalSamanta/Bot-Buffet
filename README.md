# Project Description
## Title: 
Bot-Buffet: Fundamental Analysis of a Company using Large Language Models (LLM)
## Objective: 
To develop a platform that allows users to input a company name and receive a detailed fundamental analysis report generated by a backend algorithm leveraging large language models.
## Features:
● User-friendly front-end interface for inputting company names.
● Backend algorithm that processes the input and generates a fundamental analysis report.
● Reports include financial metrics, market performance, and other key data points essential for assessing a company's fundamentals.
## Workflow
### 1. User Interface:
   ![image](https://github.com/ArghaKamalSamanta/Bot-Buffet/assets/97786651/5ffc7e4a-665f-4416-a671-e09f6b54f8b1)

● Users visit the website and are greeted with a simple, intuitive interface.
● A text input box is provided where users can enter the company name they wish to analyze.
### 2. Backend Processing:

● The company name entered by the user is sent to the backend.
● The backend utilizes a large language model to gather data and generate a comprehensive fundamental analysis report. This process involves querying databases, processing financial data, and synthesizing information into a readable report.
### 3. Report Generation:
● The backend compiles the data into a structured report format.
● This report is then sent back to the front end, where it is displayed to the user.
### 4. User Interaction:
● Users can download the report in various formats (e.g., PDF, HTML) for offline viewing and further analysis.
## Product Requirement Document (PRD)
### Functional Requirements:
● A web interface that accepts text input (company name).
● Secure and scalable backend architecture capable of handling multiple user requests simultaneously.
● Integration with financial databases and information sources to fetch the latest data.
● Real-time processing of data using a large language model.
● Capability to generate and format reports in multiple formats.
### Non-Functional Requirements:
● **Performance:** The system should be able to generate reports within a reasonable time frame (under 2 minutes).
● **Scalability:** The system should be scalable to accommodate a growing user base.
● **Security:** Implement standard security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
● **Usability:** The interface should be simple enough for users with minimal technical knowledge.
### Dependencies:
● Access to up-to-date financial databases.
● Reliable hosting for both front-end and back-end components.
● Maintenance of large language model updates and licensing.
### Assumptions:
● Users have basic knowledge of company names and an interest in performing fundamental analysis.
● Continuous availability of financial data from trusted sources.
### Constraints:
● Limited by the accuracy and comprehensiveness of data available from external sources.
● Dependence on the performance of the underlying language model.
