The company marked a historic milestone by becoming the first Indian company to cross Rs 20 lakh crore in market capitalisation in February, underscoring its dominant position in the country's corporate landscape. A major highlight was the announcement of a merger between RIL's media business and Disney, creating an $8.5 billion joint venture that aims to transform India's media and entertainment landscape. Additionally, RIL's ventures into new domains, including the setup of EV charging infrastructure through Jio-bp and entering the soundbox segment with Jio Payments, indicate its aggressive push towards diversification and innovation. These moves, coupled with strategic partnerships and expansions, such as the potential talks with Paramount for a stake sale and the launch of an AI model backed by Mukesh Ambani, further cement RIL's influence across various sectors in India.\n",

A major highlight was the announcement of a merger between RIL's media business and Disney, creating an $8.5 billion joint venture that aims to transform India's media and entertainment landscape. Additionally, RIL's ventures into new domains, including the setup of EV charging infrastructure through Jio-bp and entering the soundbox segment with Jio Payments, indicate its aggressive push towards diversification and innovation.
